# Online-Payment-Fraud-Detection

This project aims to build an effective machine learning system to detect fraudulent transactions within an online payment dataset. Fraud detection in financial transactions is a crucial task to prevent monetary losses and protect users from malicious activities. Using real-world transaction data, this project demonstrates a practical approach to identifying fraud by analyzing key transaction attributes and applying supervised learning techniques.

The dataset comprises detailed transactional information including transaction types, monetary amounts, and account balances before and after each transaction. By encoding categorical data and leveraging numerical features, a Decision Tree classification model is trained to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

##  Key Technologies Used

- **Python** – Programming language used for the entire project.
- **Pandas** – For loading, cleaning, and manipulating the dataset.
- **NumPy** – For numerical computations and handling arrays for ML input.
- **Plotly Express** – For creating interactive visualizations (e.g., donut/pie charts).
- **scikit-learn** – For machine learning tasks such as train-test split, Decision Tree classification, and evaluation.
- **scikit-learn Metrics** – For model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
