# Online-Payment-Fraud-Detection

This project aims to build an effective machine learning system to detect fraudulent transactions within an online payment dataset. Fraud detection in financial transactions is a crucial task to prevent monetary losses and protect users from malicious activities. Using real-world transaction data, this project demonstrates a practical approach to identifying fraud by analyzing key transaction attributes and applying supervised learning techniques.

The dataset comprises detailed transactional information including transaction types, monetary amounts, and account balances before and after each transaction. By encoding categorical data and leveraging numerical features, a Decision Tree classification model is trained to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
